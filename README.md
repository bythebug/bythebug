# üí´About Me :

Hey there! My name is Suraj, but you can call me the "Code Whisperer." I'm currently a B. Tech student studying Computer Science at Vel Tech University in Chennai, India, where I spend most of my days decoding and debugging code. 

In my spare time, I like to create and design things that are both functional and visually appealing. You know, because I'm not just a nerd - I'm a stylish nerd. I've had the opportunity to work on some pretty cool projects, like a web-based chatbot editing environment and a cloud-based code snippet application. 

In my previous internships at MITACS and Turquoise, I've learned a ton and contributed to the development of various products. I'm also a Lead at the Google Developers Students Club, India, where I organize hackathons and coding competitions and lead a team of 18 students to greatness (or at least, to getting our work done). 

When I'm not coding or designing, you can find me freelancing as a UI-UX designer or trying to come up with a new and improved version of the potato. Just kidding, there's no improving the potato. It's perfect just the way it is.
